In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems. Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas in AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and to fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software engineering, and robotics. In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging fields, including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and the development of software agents.     The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and computational management of knowledge.     Scope     We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR that clearly contribute to the formal foundations of relevant problems or show the applicability of results to implemented or implementable systems. We also welcome papers from other areas that show clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR.

They are characterized by mobile agents able to offer, request, discover and exploit data sensing and analysis services, enabled by embedded sensors or devices in their close proximity, connected through low-power wireless protocols. This model is typically:  - peer-to-peer: any node can request data or search for specific kinds of sensors and devices; - opportunistic: designed to exploit dynamically the available resources in a certain area in a given time window; - participatory: user agents are invited to contribute their data, sensing and computing resources to the network.  Collaborative sensing approaches should be general enough to support various types of applications, platforms and devices. Furthermore, effective incentive mechanisms should be introduced to promote a sustained collaboration. As interoperability issues involve both application-layer network protocols and data exchange formats, integrating World Wide Web - and particularly Semantic Web \u2013 technologies is a relevant research trend for promoting collaboration in large-scale data sensing and processing scenarios, such as multi-party deployments and federations.  *Submission Guidelines*  Paper must be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/submission_new?a=26151658  All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.

The maximum number of pages (including extra pages) is strictly limited to 8 pages. The submitted paper must be formatted according to the guidelines of Procedia Computer Science.  *List of Topics*  The Workshop is dedicated to frameworks, architectures, technologies and systems for collaborative sensing, with particular emphasis on ubiquitous/pervasive computing and on (Semantic) Web of Things technology stacks. Topics include, but are not limited to:  - collaborative and participatory sensing in WSN, IoT and WoT scenarios; - collaborative, decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols for device and sensor discovery; - collaborative, decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols and frameworks for data discovery, data mining and machine learning; - sensing-as-a-service frameworks, architectures and protocols; - opportunistic sensing and computing in ubiquitous contexts; - design and evaluation of incentive mechanisms for participatory sensing; - energy-conscious and resource-conscious collaborative sensing; - user-centered personalized participatory sensing tools, interfaces and applications; - Semantic Web technologies for collaborative sensing and ubiquitous sensor networks; - distributed ledger and blockchain technologies for collaborative sensing.  *Program Committee*  - Eugenio Di Sciascio, Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy - Hasan Ali Khatthak, National University of Sciences & Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan - Thilanka Munasinghe, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA - Andrea Omicini, University of Bologna Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy - Evan Patton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA - Oshani Seneviratne, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA - Quan Z.

Functional Status Information (FSI) describes physical and mental wellness at the whole-person level (as opposed to the cellular or organ level), and includes information on activity performance, social role participation, and environmental and personal factors that affect well-being and quality of life.  Collecting and analyzing this information is critical to addressing the data needs in caring for aging global populations, and providing effective care for individuals with chronic conditions, multi-morbidity, and disability.  However, FSI has proven difficult to capture systematically within existing paradigms, leaving a space ripe for technological innovation.  AI4Function is a venue for researchers cutting across data science and AI methods to discuss new ways to collect and utilize FSI within healthcare delivery, public health, and social well-being.  The first AI4Function workshop brought together researchers from fields as diverse as natural language processing, in-home sensing, psychometrics, and health policy, and we aim to continue this multidisciplinary exchange in the second iteration of the workshop.  TOPICS Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to: - Informatics methods applied to FSI, including information extraction, information retrieval, and classification of FSI (e.g. mobility, self-care, mental functioning) - Applications of AI for functional status measurement - Usage of FSI to model health outcomes/resource utilization - Terminologies and ontologies related to functional status - Analysis of FSI data (e.g., language data, wearable measurements) - Combinations of multi-modal data to capture functional status  Data sources of interest include, but are not limited to: - Medical records - Disability and work programs  - Health and human services data - Wearable devices - Social media  Targeted data types include, but are not limited to: - Unstructured (free text) narrative - Structured medical data (e.g., lab reports, range of motion assessments)  - Semi-structured reports (e.g., state welfare visit reports) - Standardized clinical surveys (e.g., PROMIS, AM-PAC, PHQ-9) - Population surveys - Wearable device measurements - Video and audio recordings  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS All submissions to AI4Function should be anonymous using the EasyChair submission site (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai4function2021). Accepted papers will be published on CEUR-WS.org, and submissions should follow the CEURART style available from: https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/.  At least one author of each accepted paper/abstract must purchase a registration for and attend the workshop.   We invite three types of submissions: - Long papers must be no longer than eight pages for the main body of the paper (including tables and figures), with unlimited space for references.  Long papers are expected to describe reports of original, unpublished research. - Short papers must be no longer than four pages for the main body of the paper (including tables and figures), with unlimited space for references.  Short papers must describe original, unpublished research, and are appropriate for preliminary results, work in progress, etc. - Abstracts must be less than two pages, including references.  Abstracts are appropriate for presenting previously-published research and work in progress.  Authors are required to submit their papers/abstracts in PDF format. Papers that are longer than the page limit will be rejected without review.   ETHICAL/SOCIETAL IMPACT It is optional, but highly recommended, for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement should be included after the main body of the paper, and does not count towards page limits.  REVIEWING PROCESS All submissions to AI4Function will go through a double-blind reviewing process. Accepted abstracts will be presented in the poster session. Accepted papers will be presented as either a talk or a poster, depending on the reviewers\u2019 recommendations.  Accepted short and long papers will be given an additional page to accommodate responses to reviewer feedback; no author response period will be used. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings on CEUR-WS.  PREPRINT POLICY The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, medRxiv, social media, websites, etc.) will not result in rejection provided that the preprints was submitted at least one month before the abstract submission deadline of AI4Function 2021.

The tasks will be significantly complicated with the greater complexity of computing systems, increasing network speed, and the newly introduced mobile and IoT devices. Such changes will render the existing telemetry and analysis techniques to be outdated, and more scalable techniques may be in place for data-driven and deeper data analysis. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative challenges, data pressure in systems and networks also  comes  from  various sources such  as sensors,  computing systems,  networking and security devices, and other \\emerging computing elements speaking with different syntax  and  semantics,  which  makes  organizing  and  incorporating  the  generated  data  difficult  for  extensive  analysis.  This workshop aims at bridging  the  systems and network measurement and the latest advances  in  machine  learning  and data science  technologies,  to  advance the  performance  and reliability of HPC and distributed systems. New analysis techniques are needed in the modern world, from the diverse angles of systems/network performance, availability, and security. For example, real-time streaming analytics algorithms and methods need to be explored for estimating network performance and summarizing the traffic variables to capture the network activities due to the network bandwidth increase. Multivariate analysis of telemetric variables may be able to provide the intuitive, comprehensive view of the systems and networks dynamics. New logging techniques are also needed in the future with the latest development in the storage and archival technologies. In addition, many applications in this area may need to address the application-specific requirements and challenges. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of data sciences and HPC/distributed computing systems.

The now dominant paradigm of data-driven AI, powered by sophisticated machine learning algorithms, employs big data to build intelligent applications and support fact-based decision making. The focus of data-driven AI is on learning (domain) models and keeping those models up-to-date by using statistical methods over big data, in contrast to the manual modeling approach prevalent in traditional, knowledge-based AI.  While data-driven AI has led to significant breakthroughs, it also comes with a number of disadvantages. First, models generated by machine learning algorithms often cannot be inspected and understood by a human being, thus lacking explainability. Furthermore, integration of preexisting domain knowledge into learned models \u2013 prior to or after learning \u2013 is difficult. Finally, correct application of data-driven AI depends on the domain, problem, and organizational context while considering human aspects as well. Conceptual modeling can be the key to applying data-driven AI in a meaningful, correct, and time-efficient way while improving maintainability, usability, and explainability.  Topics of Interest ----------------- The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: - Combining generated and manually engineered models - Combining symbolic with sub-symbolic models - Conceptual (meta-)models as background knowledge for model learning - Conceptual models for enabling explainability, model validation and plausibility checking - Trade-off between interpretability and model performance - Reasoning in generated models - Data-driven modeling support - Learning of meta-models - Automatic, incremental model adaptation - Case-based reasoning in the context of model generation and conceptual modeling - Model-driven guidance and support for data analytics lifecycle - Conceptual models for supporting users with conducting data analysis  Workshop Organizers ------------------ Dominik Bork, TU Wien, Austria Peter Fettke, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Saarland University, Germany Ulrich Reimer, Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland Marina Tropmann-Frick, University of Applied Sciences Hamburg, Germany"}, {"Conference": "STRIVE  2021 : The Fourth Intl.

Workshop on Safety, securiTy, and pRivacy In automotiVe systEms STRIVE 2021  co-located with Euro S&P September 7th, 2021, Wien, Austria http://www.iit.cnr.it/strive2021   Scope: The introduction of ICT systems into vehicles make them more prone to cyber-security attacks. Such attacks may impact on vehicles capability and, consequently, on the safety of drivers, passengers. The strong integration among dedicated ICT devices, the physical environment, and the networking infrastructure, leads to consider modern vehicles as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers and engineers in academia and industry to foster an exchange of research results, experiences, and products in the automotive domain from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Its ultimate goal is to envision new trends and ideas about aspects of designing, implementing, and evaluating innovative solutions for CPS with a particular focus on the new generation of vehicles. Indeed, the automotive domain presents several challenges in the fields of vehicular network, Internet of Things, Privacy, as well as Safety and Security methods and approaches. The workshop aims at presenting the advancement on the state of art in these fields and spreading their adoption in several scenarios involving main stockholders of the automotive domain.  The list of relevant topics includes (may be not limited to): - Architecture, design, and implementation of safe and secure Cyber-Physical Systems;  - Automated Vehicular Technologies; - Vehicular Communications and Networks; - In-Vehicle communication protocols; - User-to-Vehicle interactions and communications; - Software Process Development in Automotive systems; - Security threats and vulnerabilities of Cyber-Physical Systems; - Safety and Security Trade-off and Convergences; - Cooperative/collaborative vehicular systems; - Cyber-security solutions for connected and autonomous vehicles; - Privacy of vehicular data; - Driver behaviour characterization; - Standardization and Interoperability.  Welcome domains of application are (may be not limited to):  - Automotive; - Vehicular Network; - Internet of Things; - Cyber-Physical Systems; - Smart cities and Smart environment.
