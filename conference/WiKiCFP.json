They are characterized by mobile agents able to offer, request, discover and exploit data sensing and analysis services, enabled by embedded sensors or devices in their close proximity, connected through low-power wireless protocols. This model is typically:  - peer-to-peer: any node can request data or search for specific kinds of sensors and devices; - opportunistic: designed to exploit dynamically the available resources in a certain area in a given time window; - participatory: user agents are invited to contribute their data, sensing and computing resources to the network.  Collaborative sensing approaches should be general enough to support various types of applications, platforms and devices. Furthermore, effective incentive mechanisms should be introduced to promote a sustained collaboration. As interoperability issues involve both application-layer network protocols and data exchange formats, integrating World Wide Web - and particularly Semantic Web – technologies is a relevant research trend for promoting collaboration in large-scale data sensing and processing scenarios, such as multi-party deployments and federations.  *Submission Guidelines*  Paper must be submitted via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/submission_new?a=26151658  All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The total length for each paper is limited to 6 pages. Two extra pages can be added. But, for each extra page, a fee of €65 will be charged. The maximum number of pages (including extra pages) is strictly limited to 8 pages. The submitted paper must be formatted according to the guidelines of Procedia Computer Science.  *List of Topics*  The Workshop is dedicated to frameworks, architectures, technologies and systems for collaborative sensing, with particular emphasis on ubiquitous/pervasive computing and on (Semantic) Web of Things technology stacks. Topics include, but are not limited to:  - collaborative and participatory sensing in WSN, IoT and WoT scenarios; - collaborative, decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols for device and sensor discovery; - collaborative, decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols and frameworks for data discovery, data mining and machine learning; - sensing-as-a-service frameworks, architectures and protocols; - opportunistic sensing and computing in ubiquitous contexts; - design and evaluation of incentive mechanisms for participatory sensing; - energy-conscious and resource-conscious collaborative sensing; - user-centered personalized participatory sensing tools, interfaces and applications; - Semantic Web technologies for collaborative sensing and ubiquitous sensor networks; - distributed ledger and blockchain technologies for collaborative sensing.  *Program Committee*  - Eugenio Di Sciascio, Polytechnic University of Bari, Italy - Hasan Ali Khatthak, National University of Sciences & Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan - Thilanka Munasinghe, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA - Andrea Omicini, University of Bologna Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna, Italy - Evan Patton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA - Oshani Seneviratne, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA - Quan Z.

These challenges include load-balancing, fast data transfers, and efficient resource utilization. Task-based models and runtime systems have shown that it is possible to address these challenges by providing additional mechanisms such as oversubscription, task/data locality, shared memory, and data dependence driven execution.  This workshop explores the advantages of task-based programming on modern and future HPC systems. It will gather developers, users, and proponents of these models and systems to share experience, discuss how they meet the challenges posed by Exascale system architectures, and explore opportunities for increased performance, robustness, and full-system utilization. Topics  The workshop will focus on the following areas:  - Novel task-based runtime environments - Experiences of using task-based runtime environments for large applications - Experiences comparing task-based runtime environments - Experiences gathered from porting one large-scale parallel solution to another, e.g., MPI to Charm++, etc. - Profiling and performance monitoring of task-based environments - Benchmarks for task-based runtimes - Tools for debugging programs using task-based runtimes - Challenges to task-based runtimes in scaling to large clusters - Hardware challenges and solutions in using task-based environments"

        "call_for_papers": "[Call for Papers] The Second Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Function, Disability, and Health (AI4Function) @ IJCAI 2021 -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Where: Virtual event (host conference in Montreal, Canada) When: August 21, 22, or 23, 2021  IMPORTANT DATES Submissions due – May 5, 2021 Notification of acceptance – May 25, 2021 Camera-ready versions due – June 11, 2021 Workshop – August 21, 22, or 23, 2021  Website: https://ai4function.github.io/2021  Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai4function2021   Contact: ai4function@gmail.com  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Second Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Function, Disability, and Health (AI4Function 2021) invites the submission of abstracts, short and long papers describing research that focuses on applying informatics methods, artificial intelligence (AI) or data mining techniques in the area of whole-person care, disability, and functional status information.  Functional Status Information (FSI) describes physical and mental wellness at the whole-person level (as opposed to the cellular or organ level), and includes information on activity performance, social role participation, and environmental and personal factors that affect well-being and quality of life.  Collecting and analyzing this information is critical to addressing the data needs in caring for aging global populations, and providing effective care for individuals with chronic conditions, multi-morbidity, and disability.  However, FSI has proven difficult to capture systematically within existing paradigms, leaving a space ripe for technological innovation.  AI4Function is a venue for researchers cutting across data science and AI methods to discuss new ways to collect and utilize FSI within healthcare delivery, public health, and social well-being.  The first AI4Function workshop brought together researchers from fields as diverse as natural language processing, in-home sensing, psychometrics, and health policy, and we aim to continue this multidisciplinary exchange in the second iteration of the workshop.  TOPICS Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to: - Informatics methods applied to FSI, including information extraction, information retrieval, and classification of FSI (e.g. mobility, self-care, mental functioning) - Applications of AI for functional status measurement - Usage of FSI to model health outcomes/resource utilization - Terminologies and ontologies related to functional status - Analysis of FSI data (e.g., language data, wearable measurements) - Combinations of multi-modal data to capture functional status  Data sources of interest include, but are not limited to: - Medical records - Disability and work programs  - Health and human services data - Wearable devices - Social media  Targeted data types include, but are not limited to: - Unstructured (free text) narrative - Structured medical data (e.g., lab reports, range of motion assessments)  - Semi-structured reports (e.g., state welfare visit reports) - Standardized clinical surveys (e.g., PROMIS, AM-PAC, PHQ-9) - Population surveys - Wearable device measurements - Video and audio recordings  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS All submissions to AI4Function should be anonymous using the EasyChair submission site (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ai4function2021). Accepted papers will be published on CEUR-WS.org, and submissions should follow the CEURART style available from: https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/.  At least one author of each accepted paper/abstract must purchase a registration for and attend the workshop.   We invite three types of submissions: - Long papers must be no longer than eight pages for the main body of the paper (including tables and figures), with unlimited space for references.  Long papers are expected to describe reports of original, unpublished research. - Short papers must be no longer than four pages for the main body of the paper (including tables and figures), with unlimited space for references.  Short papers must describe original, unpublished research, and are appropriate for preliminary results, work in progress, etc. - Abstracts must be less than two pages, including references.  Abstracts are appropriate for presenting previously-published research and work in progress.  Authors are required to submit their papers/abstracts in PDF format. Papers that are longer than the page limit will be rejected without review.   ETHICAL/SOCIETAL IMPACT It is optional, but highly recommended, for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement should be included after the main body of the paper, and does not count towards page limits.  REVIEWING PROCESS All submissions to AI4Function will go through a double-blind reviewing process. Accepted abstracts will be presented in the poster session. Accepted papers will be presented as either a talk or a poster, depending on the reviewers’ recommendations.  Accepted short and long papers will be given an additional page to accommodate responses to reviewer feedback; no author response period will be used. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings on CEUR-WS.  PREPRINT POLICY The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, medRxiv, social media, websites, etc.) will not result in rejection provided that the preprints was submitted at least one month before the abstract submission deadline of AI4Function 2021. Note that the submission to EasyChair must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Preprints (last update) uploaded no more than one month before the AI4Function 2021 abstract submission deadline will be considered as violating anonymity.  CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY AI4Function will adopt the IJCAI confidentiality policy, where all submissions will be treated in strict confidence until the publication date.

The tasks will be significantly complicated with the greater complexity of computing systems, increasing network speed, and the newly introduced mobile and IoT devices. Such changes will render the existing telemetry and analysis techniques to be outdated, and more scalable techniques may be in place for data-driven and deeper data analysis. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative challenges, data pressure in systems and networks also  comes  from  various sources such  as sensors,  computing systems,  networking and security devices, and other \\emerging computing elements speaking with different syntax  and  semantics,  which  makes  organizing  and  incorporating  the  generated  data  difficult  for  extensive  analysis.  This workshop aims at bridging  the  systems and network measurement and the latest advances  in  machine  learning  and data science  technologies,  to  advance the  performance  and reliability of HPC and distributed systems. New analysis techniques are needed in the modern world, from the diverse angles of systems/network performance, availability, and security. For example, real-time streaming analytics algorithms and methods need to be explored for estimating network performance and summarizing the traffic variables to capture the network activities due to the network bandwidth increase. Multivariate analysis of telemetric variables may be able to provide the intuitive, comprehensive view of the systems and networks dynamics. New logging techniques are also needed in the future with the latest development in the storage and archival technologies. In addition, many applications in this area may need to address the application-specific requirements and challenges. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of data sciences and HPC/distributed computing systems.   Topic of interest (but not limited to):  - Systems and network measurement, analysis, and summarization - HPC, superfacility, and distributed systems - Data-driven, multivariate, streaming-based data processing - Distributed and federated machine learning - Performance modeling, analysis, and engineering - Cybersecurity, forensics, privacy, and anonymization - Intelligent workflow, visualization, and applications - Smart instruments, edge/fog-systems, and IoTs - Wireless, mobile/5G networks - Software-Defined-* technologies - Storage and archival technologies - Experiences and practices on systems/network data analysis"

The now dominant paradigm of data-driven AI, powered by sophisticated machine learning algorithms, employs big data to build intelligent applications and support fact-based decision making. The focus of data-driven AI is on learning (domain) models and keeping those models up-to-date by using statistical methods over big data, in contrast to the manual modeling approach prevalent in traditional, knowledge-based AI.  While data-driven AI has led to significant breakthroughs, it also comes with a number of disadvantages. First, models generated by machine learning algorithms often cannot be inspected and understood by a human being, thus lacking explainability. Furthermore, integration of preexisting domain knowledge into learned models – prior to or after learning – is difficult. Finally, correct application of data-driven AI depends on the domain, problem, and organizational context while considering human aspects as well. Conceptual modeling can be the key to applying data-driven AI in a meaningful, correct, and time-efficient way while improving maintainability, usability, and explainability.  Topics of Interest ----------------- The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: - Combining generated and manually engineered models - Combining symbolic with sub-symbolic models - Conceptual (meta-)models as background knowledge for model learning - Conceptual models for enabling explainability, model validation and plausibility checking - Trade-off between interpretability and model performance - Reasoning in generated models - Data-driven modeling support - Learning of meta-models - Automatic, incremental model adaptation - Case-based reasoning in the context of model generation and conceptual modeling - Model-driven guidance and support for data analytics lifecycle - Conceptual models for supporting users with conducting data analysis  Workshop Organizers ------------------ Dominik Bork, TU Wien, Austria Peter Fettke, German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Saarland University, Germany Ulrich Reimer, Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland Marina Tropmann-Frick, University of Applied Sciences Hamburg, Germany"
